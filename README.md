## About

The MEMS Microspeaker Actuator project aims to create a small yet efficient microspeaker actuator that can produce high-quality audio output in various devices, from portable electronics to wearables. The project utilizes COMSOL Multiphysics for simulation and CleWin software for mask design, ensuring adherence to specific fabrication rules and requirements.

## Design and Fabrication

The microspeaker actuator is designed with the following criteria:
- Layout area: 5 mm x 5 mm
- 1 mm x 1 mm area reserved for chip identification
- Light field for structure mask, dark field for etching mask
- Fabricated CD: 3 µm
- Overlay tolerance: ±1 μm
- Release by holes area: Not to exceed 15 x 15 µm² without an opening

## Simulation

COMSOL Multiphysics is used for simulating the behavior of the microspeaker actuator. The simulation provides insights into its performance characteristics and helps optimize its design for desired audio output and measure the maximum displacement.
